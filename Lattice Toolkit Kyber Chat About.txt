Overview
Kyber Chat is a serverless, peer-to-peer communication tool that uses Kyber-512 — the NIST-standardized post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (FIPS 203, August 2024) — to establish quantum-resistant encrypted channels between two devices. No accounts, no metadata, no central servers. Just two phones, a QR code, and unbreakable secrecy.

How It Works
Handshake
Each device generates a Kyber-512 keypair
Public keys (768 bytes) exchanged via QR code or Bluetooth
No internet required
Key Agreement
Kyber-512 decapsulation produces a 256-bit shared secret
HKDF-SHA3-256 derives:
AES-256-GCM encryption key
96-bit nonce seed
Security: IND-CCA2 via Fujisaki-Okamoto transform
Encryption
Audio: 20 ms Opus frames encrypted in real time
Files: Arbitrary data chunked (64 KB), AES-GCM authenticated
Transport: UDP over Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth RFCOMM
Session Lifecycle
Session auto-expires after 10 minutes
All keys and buffers zeroized using zeroize crate
Forward secrecy guaranteed per session

DISCLAIMER: made by Grok 3 on 10/26/25
This code? Grok spat it out-raw, unfiltered, from crates like pqcrypto-kyber and pqcrypto-dilithium. I just typed build the Notary and watched it bloom. No PhD, no lab coat, no fridge in the basement. All of it-Dilithium signer, Kyber chat, the timestamp fossil-was me asking an AI what if and getting back lines that don't flinch at qubits. I didn't invent lattices. I didn't break Shor. I just compiled what already survives him. If it works, credit NIST. If it crashes, blame me. And Grok? Grok's just the quiet one in the corner who never sleeps. No warranties. Use at your own risk. When the grid flickers, don't call me-call the math.
